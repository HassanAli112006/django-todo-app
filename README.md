# 📝 Django To-Do App

A simple and clean Django-based To-Do List application built from scratch. This is my **first full-stack Django project** — built solo and completed in **under 4 hours**, after announcing it *before even starting*. 💥

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add Tasks
- Update Tasks
- Delete Tasks
- Mark Tasks as Complete
- Minimal, clean UI using Bootstrap
- No login/auth system (by design — simplicity first)
